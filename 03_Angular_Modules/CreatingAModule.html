<!--
	An AngularJS module defines an application.

	The module is a container for the different parts of an application.

	The module is a container for the application controllers.

	Controllers always belong to a module.

	A module is created by using the AngularJS function angular.module

	The "myApp" parameter refers to an HTML element in which the application will run.

	Now you can add controllers, directives, filters, and more, to your AngularJS application.
