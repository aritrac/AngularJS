<!--
The ng-app directive is placed at the root element of the application.

For single page applications (SPA), the root of the application is often the <html> element.

One or more ng-controller directives define the application controllers. Each controller has its own scope: the HTML element where they were defined.

AngularJS starts automatically on the HTML DOMContentLoaded event. If an ng-app directive is found, AngularJS will load any module named in the directive, and compile the DOM with ng-app as the root of the application.

The root of the application can be the whole page, or a smaller portion of the page. The smaller the portion, the faster the application will compile and execute.

Above you have the skeleton (scaffolding) of a real life AngularJS, single page application (SPA).

The <html> element is the "container" for the AngularJS application (ng-app=).

A <div> elements defines the scope of an AngularJS controller (ng-controller=).

You can have many controllers in one application.

An application file (my...App.js) defines the application module code.

One or more controller files (my...Ctrl.js) defines the controller code.
