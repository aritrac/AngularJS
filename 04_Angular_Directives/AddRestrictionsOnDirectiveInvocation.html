<!--
	You can restrict your directives to only be invoked by some of the methods.
	By adding a restrict property with the value "A", the directive can only be invoked by attributes:
	The legal restrict values are:
		E for Element name
		A for Attribute
		C for Class
		M for Comment
	By default the value is EA, meaning that both Element names and attribute names can invoke the directive.
