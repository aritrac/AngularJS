<!--
When you make a controller in AngularJS, you pass the $scope object as an argument:
When adding properties to the $scope object in the controller, the view (HTML) gets access to these properties.
In the view, you do not use the prefix $scope, you just refer to a propertyname, like {{carname}}.

<div ng-app="myApp" ng-controller="myCtrl">

<h1>{{carname}}</h1>

</div>

<script>
var app = angular.module('myApp', []);
app.controller('myCtrl', function($scope) {
    $scope.carname = "Volvo";
});
</script>

<p>The property "carname" was made in the controller, and can be referred to in the view by using the {{ }} brackets.</p>
